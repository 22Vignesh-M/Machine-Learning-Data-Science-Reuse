## Crash course for Data Science in Python

### Why Python?
1. Multi-paradigm
2. Dynamic typing
3. A lot of libraries, not just particular data science
4. Easy to create an API

### What does it cover?
1. Short introduction for Python
2. numpy library for linear system library
3. matplotlib library for drawing and graph library
4. pandas library for dataframe library
5. Standardization data
6. Normalization data
7. Principal Component explanation

### Extra
1. Correlation study for drugs in Malaysia

This is what I do during MAMPU data Hackathon 2017. After pitching session, one of the judges come to me and ask to present myself at Axiata Tower for the next day. Skip to next day, I got job opportunity as full-time Data Scientist with starting wage RM4.5K

### What included in the system mampu/
1. Correlation study for drugs in Malaysia
2. Bancian study
3. Bancian forecasting
4. 3D visualization for happiness countries
5. 3D visualization for economic growth
6. Use Materialize css framework
7. Plotly libraries
8. Mapbox API
9. Flask API for bancian forecasting using Gradient Tree Boosting

I code it from scratch and able to complete it in 24 hours. You can get the code for the system in mampu/

You can check the system [here](http://www.huseinhouse.com/mampu/)

### I assumed all able to use command line to install any packages. Linux and Mac got terminal, Windows got Cygwin.

### How to install Python and PIP
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Libraries needed
```bash
sudo pip install scipy numpy matplotlib pandas
```

### Install Jupyter notebook
```bash
sudo pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### If you want to use Python3, just change python3-pip, python3-dev, pip3
#### If you are familiar with MATLAB, numpy and matplotlib got similar syntax with native MATLAB
