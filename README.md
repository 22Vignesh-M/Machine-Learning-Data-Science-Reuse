# Machine-Learning-Reuse
Techniques that I reused for my machine learning problems without deep learning


### NLP
1. Bag Of Word
2. TF-IDF
3. Hashing algorithm
4. Speech Tagging
5. Baiyes Classification
6. Linear System Classification
7. xgboosting
8. sklearn pipeline
9. lightbgm
10. N-gram

### Image processing
1. Augmentation (flip, rotate, shifting, zoom, shear, channel shift, grayscale, contrast, saturation)
2. RGB subdivide
3. hog-featuring

### Signal processing
1. Augmentation (pitching, speed, distribution noise, shifting, silent shifting)
2. Featuring (mfcc, log-energy, feature cube, power spectrum)

### Classification
1. stacking model
2. featuring

### Regression
1. stacking model
2. featuring

### Binary
1. stacking XGB with LGB
2. ensemble genetic algorithm, deep feed-forward neural network, xgb and lgb

### Stacking
1. stack multiple models from sklearn regressor with XGB
